# comparator-in-VHDL-
This is a comparator project
I carried out this task according to the given comparator truth table https://www.maxybyte.com/p/introduction-i-carried-out-my-lab.html, the simplicity of the table could be made understandable by some 3 simple logic: i.e. eq is 1 when a=b, gr is 1 when a > b and ls is 1 when a < b. The purpose of this task is to show how to implement comparator table with Vivado 2018.2 as well as the synthesis comparison and view each of its output on LED from FPGA board.
